Real-Time Settlement for Indian Stock Markets
Blockchain-based atomic Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) settlement using Hyperledger Fabric

Overview
This project implements a permissioned blockchain settlement layer that enables real-time settlement of equity trades on Indian stock markets. Instead of the traditional T+1 settlement cycle, trades are settled in 2–10 seconds using atomic smart contract execution on Hyperledger Fabric.

Architecture
Trader → Broker → Exchange → Settlement Smart Contract → Blockchain Ledger
Network Participants
Participant	Role
Exchange Node	Submits trade records for settlement
Clearing Corp Node	Validates and monitors clearing obligations
Broker Node	Represents buy/sell parties
Bank Node	Manages cash settlement accounts
Regulator Node	Read-only audit and compliance access
Smart Contracts
Securities Contract — Manages equity ownership records (create, issue, transfer, query)
Payment Contract — Manages bank settlement accounts (create, credit, debit, transfer)
Settlement Contract — Executes atomic DvP (simultaneous share + cash transfer in one transaction)
Prerequisites
Docker & Docker Compose
Go 1.21+
Node.js 18+
Hyperledger Fabric binaries (2.5+)
Quick Start
# 1. Start the Fabric network
./scripts/start-network.sh

# 2. Create the settlement channel
./scripts/create-channel.sh

# 3. Deploy all three chaincodes
./scripts/deploy-chaincode.sh

# 4. Run the demo settlement
cd application/client-sdk
npm install
node app.js
Demo Scenario
State	BrokerA	BrokerB
Before	₹500,000 cash	100 RELIANCE shares
Trade	Buys 100 RELIANCE @ ₹2,500	Sells 100 RELIANCE @ ₹2,500
After	₹250,000 cash + 100 shares	₹250,000 cash + 0 shares
Settlement completes in seconds with full atomicity — if any step fails, the entire transaction rolls back.
