## Core Technologies & Refinements

- **Backend / Ethers v6**: The backend connects to the local Hardhat node using Ethers.js v6. All signers are wrapped in `ethers.NonceManager` to automatically handle transaction nonces accurately under heavy load. Addresses from signers are fetched asynchronously via `await getAddress()` to prevent mapping errors.
- **Frontend / Blueprint Sketch UI**: The UI features a ultra-clean, hand-drawn "blueprint" aesthetic. Visual elements include a floating container island over a pure dark background, deep charcoal and slate blue hues, a sidebar with a dynamic "breathing" neon connectivity dot, and a 3-dot hover statistics menu utilizing glassmorphism (frosted glass) and SVG back-drop blurs.
- **Terminal Settlement Receipts**: When a trade successfully settles, a detailed receipt is printed directly in the backend Node.js terminal showing the exact timestamp and the remaining wallet balances for both the Buyer and Seller.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- npm

### Step 1 -- Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2 -- Compile Smart Contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Step 3 -- Start the Local Blockchain Node

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npm run node
```

Keep this terminal open. This starts a local Hardhat blockchain at http://127.0.0.1:8545.

### Step 4 -- Deploy Contracts & Mint Demo Tokens

In another terminal:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Deploy AssetContract (BOND), PaymentToken (SET), and SettlementEngine
- Mint 1000 BOND to the demo seller
- Mint 5000 SET to the demo buyer
- Write contract addresses to backend/deployment.json

### Step 5 -- Start the Backend Server

```bash
npm run backend
```

Server runs at http://localhost:3001. Keep this window open to monitor trade lifecycle events and the detailed settlement receipts.

### Step 6 -- Open the Frontend

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

## How to Use the Dashboard

### Demo Accounts (Hardhat local network)

| Role     | Address                                      | Initial Balance |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Deployer | 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 | Admin           |
| Buyer    | 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8 | 5000 SET        |
| Seller   | 0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC | 1000 BOND       |

### Trade Lifecycle

1. **Create Trade** -- Fill in the seller address, BOND amount, SET amount, and click Create Trade. The buyer initiates the trade.
2. **Confirm Trade** -- Click Confirm on the trade row. The seller approves and confirms.
3. **Settle Trade** -- Click Settle. The smart contract atomically swaps BOND (seller->buyer) and SET (buyer->seller) in a single transaction.

Check the terminal window running `npm run backend` to see the transaction receipt and balance left-offs immediately following settlement.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| POST   | /trade/create      | Create a new trade               |
| POST   | /trade/confirm     | Confirm a trade (seller)         |
| POST   | /trade/settle      | Atomically settle a trade (DvP)  |
| GET    | /trade/list        | List all trades from blockchain  |
| GET    | /portfolio/:addr   | Get BOND & SET balances          |

---

## Smart Contracts

### SettlementEngine -- DvP Logic

```
settleTrade(tradeId)
  |- transferFrom(seller -> buyer, BOND amount)   <-- Asset delivery
  └- transferFrom(buyer  -> seller, SET amount)   <-- Payment
         ^ Both or neither -- atomic!
```

If either token transfer fails, the entire transaction reverts.

## Safety Notice

- Runs entirely on a local Hardhat node -- no external network connections
- Uses demo tokens only (BOND, SET) -- no real monetary value
- Private keys used are the well-known Hardhat test keys -- never use these on a real network
- For educational and prototyping purposes only
